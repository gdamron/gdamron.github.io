previously been outsourced. I scaled the team from one person (me) to multiple
teams encompassing Android, iOS, web, desktop, and backend development. As an
engineering leader and product owner, my approach was to define the foundational
patterns of our apps, services, and process with the goal of handing them off to
be improved by other members of the team as it grew. The extent to which I was
hands-on as an engineer or focused on facilitating others varied depending on
the needs of the team and our products. My overriding goal is always to foster a
culture and design processes that promote rapid iteration, creativity, and a
healthy team.</p> <ul><li>Built new iOS and Android apps for interacting with generative music.</li> <li>Created fault-tolerant infrastructure for deploying generative live streams to
YouTube on demand.</li> <li>Launched development of the company's Studio product, a consumer desktop
application for curating generative music.</li> <li>Automated release and API integration of our Machine Learning models.</li> <li>Led a modernization effort of our core technologies and backend. This
multiphase effort included abstracting tightly coupled client-side code,
injecting a GraphQL layer, migrating from a legacy monolith to a more flexible
suite of services, and adding future-forward infrastructure to improve
scalability and performance.

instrument plugins, and creator tools that help musicians realize their visions.
I was the first member of the Long-Term Bets team, reporting directly to the
CEO. In addition to being an individual contributor, I helped grow the team to
include multiple engineers and a designer, serving as an informal team lead and
product manager.</p> <ul><li><p>Designed a new graph-based data architecture for managing music projects that
might include components from DAW projects and sample collections to written
notes and voice memos.</p></li> <li><p>Helped bring the Studio product from the legacy Desktop app to the new one and
created the initial integration of CoSo, the company's generative AI product.</p></li> <li><p>Integrated the graph architecture into the backend of the CoSo app. This
allowed for CoSo Stacks to be shared easily across users and applications.</p></li> <li><p>Updated the internal Ableton Live parsers to support exporting Stacks from the
CoSo app as DAW session files.</p> <blockquote><p>Golang, TypeScript, C++, Angular, Electron, AWS</p></blockquote></li></ul> <h3 id="lead-engineer-technical-director-enklu"><a href="#lead-engineer-technical-director-enklu" class="header-anchor">#</a> Lead Engineer (Technical Director) <span class="light">//</span> <span class="accent">Enklu</span></h3> <h4 id="_2019-2021-augmented-reality"><a href="#_2019-2021-augmented-reality" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2019-2021 <span class="light">//</span> Augmented Reality</h4> <p>Enklu Cloud is the Google Docs for Augmented Reality.
