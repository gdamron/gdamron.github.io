## Recent Experience

### Head of Engineering <span class="light">//</span> <span class="accent">Aimi</span>

#### 2022-2024 <span class="light">//</span> Generative AI, Music

I was the founding member of the production engineering team, an effort that had
previously been outsourced. I scaled the team from one person (me) to multiple
teams encompassing Android, iOS, web, desktop, and backend development. As an
engineering leader and product owner, my approach was to define the foundational
patterns of our apps, services, and process with the goal of handing them off to
be improved by other members of the team as it grew. The extent to which I was
hands-on as an engineer or focused on facilitating others varied depending on
the needs of the team and our products. My overriding goal is always to foster a
culture and design processes that promote rapid iteration, creativity, and a
healthy team.

- Built new iOS and Android apps for interacting with generative music.
- Created fault-tolerant infrastructure for deploying generative live streams to
  YouTube on demand.
- Launched development of the company's Studio product, a consumer desktop
  application for curating generative music.
- Automated release and API integration of our Machine Learning models.
- Led a modernization effort of our core technologies and backend. This
  multiphase effort included abstracting tightly coupled client-side code,
  injecting a GraphQL layer, migrating from a legacy monolith to a more flexible
  suite of services, and adding future-forward infrastructure to improve
  scalability and performance.

Splice is a cloud-based music creation platform providing, audio loop, software
instrument plugins, and creator tools that help musicians realize their visions.

CEO. In addition to being an individual contributor, I helped grow the team to
include multiple engineers and a designer, serving as an informal team lead and
product manager.

  might include components from DAW projects and sample collections to written
  notes and voice memos.
- Helped bring the Studio product from the legacy Desktop app to the new one and
  created the initial integration of CoSo, the company's generative AI product.
- Integrated the graph architecture into the backend of the CoSo app. This
  allowed for CoSo Stacks to be shared easily across users and applications.
- Updated the internal Ableton Live parsers to support exporting Stacks from the
  CoSo app as DAW session files.

Enklu Cloud is the Google Docs for Augmented Reality. Enklu's software allows
creative teams to collaboratively edit 3D content and instantly deploy
experiences to Mixed Reality devices. I joined Enklu as a Lead and grew to

Nomadic was a platform for creating and administering location-based VR
experiences, where users interact with objects in the real world while also
engaging with a virtual environment. I joined as an individual contributor and
grew to lead the engineering team.

  multiplayer gameplay sessions, and motion capture in C, C#, and C++.
- Architected cloud-based infrastructure (on AWS) for managing player accounts,
  operator accounts, ticketing, real-time analytics and leaderboards.
- Created a software distribution system for deploying game content and internal
  applications to on-premise servers, embedded devices, and backpack computers.

### Freelance Music Composition <span class="light">//</span> <span class="accent">ilusiv</span>

#### 2002-Present <span class="light">//</span> Stage, Screen, and Immersive Environment

Over the years, I have composed dozens of compositions, varying from
traditional, notated compositions and commercial scores to interactive
installations and generative works that exist only as code.

- Creating a serverless framework from streaming dynamically generated audio for
  generative compositions.
- Continuously composing Improvisations, generative musical sketches using a
  variety of languages. The intention is to explore a different musical idea
  each week and release the results as code.
- Created Paramitas, where users are encouraged to solve a tangible, musical
  puzzle by playing with a set of spherical objects on a small table. Solving
  the puzzle uncovers a pre-composed work for solo violin.
